ami-io - node.js/io.js client for Asterisk AMI.
===========================

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/NumminorihSF/ami-io.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a AMI client.  List of available commands is below.

Install with:

    npm install ami-io


## Usage

Simple example:

```js

    var AmiIo = require("ami-io"),
        SilentLogger = new AmiIo.SilentLogger(), //use SilentLogger if you just want remove logs
        amiio = AmiIo.createClient(),
        amiio2 = new AmiIo.Client({ logger: SilentLogger });

    //Both of this are similar

    amiio.on('incorrectServer', function () {
        amiio.logger.error("Invalid AMI welcome message. Are you sure if this is AMI?");
        process.exit();
    });
    amiio.on('connectionRefused', function(){
        amiio.logger.error("Connection refused.");
        process.exit();
    });
    amiio.on('incorrectLogin', function () {
        amiio.logger.error("Incorrect login or password.");
        process.exit();
    });
    amiio.on('event', function(event){
        amiio.logger.info('event:', event);
    });
    amiio.connect();
    amiio.on('connected', function(){
        setTimeout(function(){
            amiio.disconnect();
            amiio.on('disconnected', process.exit());
        },30000);
    });

```

Used events you can see below.

### Standalone run

You can use `node index.js user password [host[:port]] [-h host] [-p port]` to test lib and watch events on screen.
Also, if you use `-f filePath` parameter on run - before close node, it will try to write array of events to file.


# API

## Connection Events

`client` will emit some events about the state of the connection to the AMI.

### "connectionRefused"

`client` will emit `connectionRefused` if server refused connection.

### "incorrectServer"

`client` will emit `incorrectServer` if server, you try connect is not an AMI.

### "incorrectLogin"

`client` will emit `incorrectLogin` if login or password aren't valid.

### "connected"

`client` will emit `connect` after connect to AMI and success authorize.

### "disconnected"

`client` will emit `disconnect` when connection close.

## AMI Events

### "event"

`client` will emit `event` when has new event object. All of them should find at
https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+11+AMI+Events.

### "responseEvent"

`client` will emit `responseEvent` when some response has event as part of itself.

### "rawEvent"

`client` will emit `rawEvent` when has new event object or a part of response object.
Note that use event and rawEvent at the same time is not a good idea.

### "rawEvent."+eventName

`client` will emit `rawEvent.`+eventName when has new event object or a part of response object.
You can find event names at https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+11+AMI+Events



# Methods

## amiio.createClient()

* `amiio.createClient() = amiio.createClient({port:5038, host:'127.0.0.1', login:'admin', password:'admin'})`

If some of object key are undefined - will use default value.

* `host`: which host amiio should use. Defaults to `127.0.0.1`.
* `port`: which port amiio should use. Defaults to `5038`.
* `login`: Default to `admin`.
* `password`: Default to `admin`.


## client.connect([shouldReconnect[, reconnectTimeout]])

When connecting to AMI servers you can use: `client.connect(true)` to create connection with auto-reconnect.
Auto-reconnect works only if auth was success. If you use `client.disconnect()` connection will close and
shouldn't be any reconnect.
If use `client.connect()` reconnect will not work.

Default reconnect timeout is 5000ms.

Also you may want to set timeout of reconnecting. Then use `client.connect(true, timeoutInMs)`.
You don't need to set up timeout for every time you connect (in one client object). After `client.disconnect()`
timeout will not be set to default, so you can use `client.connect(true)` to connect again with similar timeout.


## client.disconnect()

Forcibly close the connection to the AMI server.  Also stop reconnecting.


```js
    var amiio = require("ami-io"),
        client = amiio.createClient();

    client.connect();
    //Some code here
    client.disconnect();
```


## client.unref()

Call `unref()` on the underlying socket connection to the AMI server,
allowing the program to exit once no more commands are pending.

```js
var AmiIo = require("ami-io");
var client = AmiIo.createClient();

/*
    Calling unref() will allow this program to exit immediately after the get command finishes.
    Otherwise the client would hang as long as the client-server connection is alive.
*/
client.unref();
//will close process if only AmiIo is in it.
client.connect();
```

## client.ref()

Call `ref()` will cancel `unref()` effect.

## client.useLogger

Use `client.useLogger(LoggerObject)` if you want to use some another logger.
By default use console and ignore any logging levels.

```js
var AmiIo = require("ami-io");
var client = AmiIo.createClient();
var client.useLogger(logger);
```

logger should has `trace`,`debug`,`info`,`warn`,`error`,`fatal` methods.
Of course you can emulate them if some lib has not it.


# Extras

Some other things you might like to know about.

## client.connected

`true` if client is connected of `false` if it is not.

## client.reconnectionTimeout

Timeout for reconnect. If you didn't want reconnect ever, `client.reconnectionTimeout == undefined`.

## client.shouldReconnect

`true` if will be reconnect, or `false` if will not.

Description of all commands and variables they need, you can find at
https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+11+AMI+Actions
All values, needed in commands, should passed like this:

```js
    var action = new amiio.Action.QueueSummary();
    action.queue = "some queue's name";
    amiioClient.send(action, function(err, data){
        if (err){
            //in current time - may be without error. need test
            //err === null if ami response match(/success/i), else response will pass as error
        }
    });
```

### Action Variables

If you need send some variables to AMI, use `action.variables` object like this:

```js
    var action = new amiio.Action.SomeAction();
    action.variables.VariableA = 1;
    action.variables.VariableB = 2;
    action.variables.VariableC = 3;
```
Or you can do it like this:
```js
    var action = new amiio.Action.SomeAction();
    action.variables = {
      VariableA: 1,
      VariableB: 2,
      VariableC: 3
    };
```

Be sure, that you don't use the same names for different values.

## Action.Originate

Now, you can send OriginateAction with response like OriginateResponse event.
See https://wiki.asterisk.org/wiki/display/AST/Asterisk+13+ManagerEvent_OriginateResponse for description.

```js
    var action = new amiio.Action.Originate();
    action.Channel = 'sip/123';
    action.Context = 'default';
    action.Exten = '456';
    action.Priority = 1;
    action.Async = true;
    action.WaitEvent = true;
    
    amiioClient.send(action, function(err, data){
        if (err){
            //err will be event like OriginateResponse if (#response !== 'Success')
        }
        else {
            //data is event like OriginateResponse if (#response === 'Success')
        }
    });
```

## SilentLogger

If you want remove logs, you may use `AmiIo.SilentLogger`'s instance as logger.
Just pass it as argument to AmiIo constructor.
